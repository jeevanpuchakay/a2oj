Given an integer array,
you need to find one continuous subarray that if you only sort this subarray in ascending order,
then the whole array will be sorted in ascending order, too.


Solution:

find the shortest index with having value greater than the next number in the array say i,

now start from the end and traverse backwards till 
the lower index element is greater than higher index element say j

try to pick up the least element from i to j 

and change i to the least elemnt which is greater than min(i,j), 
j to the largest element which is less than max(i,j)

therefore required indexes are i,j .
